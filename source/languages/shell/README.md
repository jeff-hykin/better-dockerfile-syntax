# What does this do?
This enables your theme to better color your code. There are "textmate scopes" that your theme uses to apply color, this extension adds/improves the textmate scopes which should improve the way your code looks.

NOTE: The default VS Code theme does not color much. Use a theme like one of the following to benefit from the changes:
- [Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme)
- [Noctis](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liviuschera.noctis)
- [XD Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jeff-hykin.xd-theme)
- [One Monokai Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=azemoh.one-monokai)
- [Winteriscoming](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.winteriscoming)
- [Popping and Locking](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hedinne.popping-and-locking-vscode)
- [Syntax Highlight Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=peaceshi.syntax-highlight)

## How do I use it?
Just install the VS Code extension and the changes will automatically be applied to all relevent files.
